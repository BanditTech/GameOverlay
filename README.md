# Contribution rules
Good way to start is to fix one of the existing issue OR add a new issue ( if it's already not there ).

- Do not merge anything directly to master branch, create an MR

- Performance and number of offsets required to implement a feature is very very important to me so due to this reason your MR might be rejected or asked to be modified.

- If your MR or idea is rejected feel free to create a branch or fork this tool and do whatever you want.

- Only I will release the GH tool to OC website or discord thread.
